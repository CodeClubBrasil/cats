## Introduction

Create a simple line following game in Scratch. Guide the cats to safety - don't let any fall through the gaps!

### What you will make

Here is a preview of what you will make:

<div class="scratch-preview">
    <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/59279346/?autostart=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

Click and drag with the mouse to draw a line with the pencil. Your objective is to stop the cats falling to their doom by creating a safe path to the exit.
